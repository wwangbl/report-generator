Celecoxib,Cardiovascular Agents,Cardiovascular Agents,Osteoarthritis; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Ankylosing Spondylitis; Acute Pain; Dysmenorrhea,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,Results in higher systemic concentrations. Reduce starting dose to half of the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers. Consider alternative therapy in poor metabolizers with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
Dronabinol,Antiemetics,Emetogenic Therapy Adjuncts,Antiemetic for Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV); Appetite Stimulation in AIDS-Related Anorexia; Synthetic Cannabinoid;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,May result in higher systemic concentrations and higher adverse reaction risk. Monitor for adverse reactions.
Efavirenz,Antivirals,"Anti-HIV Agents, Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTI)",HIV Treatment; Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT);,CYP2B6,*9/*9,Poor Metabolizer,Results in higher systemic concentrations and higher adverse reaction risk (QT prolongation).
Eliglustat,"Genetic, Enzyme, or Protein Disorder: Replacement, Modifiers, Treatment",,Gaucher Disease Type 1;,CYP2D6,*1/*1,Normal Metabolizer,"Alters systemic concentrations, effectiveness, and adverse reaction risk (QT prolongation). Indicated for normal, intermediate, and poor metabolizer patients. Ultrarapid metabolizers may not achieve adequate concentrations to achieve a therapeutic effect. The recommended dosages are based on CYP2D6 metabolizer status. Coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated in intermediate and poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. Refer to FDA labeling for specific dosing recommendations."
Erdafitinib,Antineoplastics,Molecular Target Inhibitors,Bladder Cancer Treatment; FGFR Alterations;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,May result in higher systemic concentrations and higher adverse reaction risk. Monitor for adverse reactions.
Flurbiprofen,Analgesics,Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs,Pain Relief; Inflammation; Postoperative Pain;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,Results in higher systemic concentrations. Use a reduced dosage in poor metabolizers.
Ibuprofen,Analgesics,Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs,Pain Relief; Anti-inflammatory; Fever Reduction;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,May result in higher systemic concentrations.
Irinotecan,Antineoplastics,Molecular Target Inhibitors,Colorectal Cancer; Gastrointestinal Cancers; Small Cell Lung Cancer;,UGT1A1,*1/*6,Intermediate Metabolizer,"Results in higher systemic active metabolite concentrations and higher adverse reaction risk (severe or life-threatening neutropenia, severe diarrhea). Closely monitor for neutropenia during and after treatment. Consider reducing the starting dosage by at least one level in poor metabolizers and modify the dosage based on individual patient tolerance. Refer to FDA labeling for specific dosing recommendations."
Meloxicam,Analgesics,Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs,Osteoarthritis; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Ankylosing Spondylitis; Other Painful Inflammatory Conditions;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,Results in higher systemic concentrations. Consider dose reductions in poor metabolizers. Monitor patients for adverse reactions.
Nateglinide,Blood Glucose Regulators,Antidiabetic Agents,Type 2 Diabetes;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,Results in higher systemic concentrations and may result in higher adverse reaction risk (hypoglycemia). Dosage reduction is recommended. Increase monitoring frequency for adverse reactions. Refer to FDA labeling for specific dosing recommendations.
Piroxicam,Analgesics,Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs,Pain and Inflammation; Acute Gout; Post-Surgical Pain;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,Results in higher systemic concentrations. Consider reducing dosage in poor metabolizers.
Siponimod,Central Nervous System Agents,Multiple Sclerosis Agents,Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis; Active Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) with Relapses;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,Results in higher systemic concentrations. Adjust dosage based on genotype. Do not use in patients with CYP2C9 *3/*3 genotype. Refer to FDA labeling for specific dosing recommendations.
Warfarin,Blood Products and Modifiers,Anticoagulants,Prevention and Treatment of Thrombosis; Stroke Prevention; Prosthetic Heart Valves; Hypercoagulable Conditions;,CYP2C9,*3/*3,Poor Metabolizer,"Alters systemic concentrations and dosage requirements. Select initial dosage, taking into account clinical and genetic factors. Monitor and adjust dosages based on INR."
