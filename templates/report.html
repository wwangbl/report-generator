            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                Your genetic blueprint, steeped in your DNA, is the most critical factor in determining who you are. From the beginning 
                of life to your golden years, it is these unique genetic variants that set you apart from your relatives and acquaintances. 
                As you navigate through the later stages of life, an interplay of these inherent genetic traits, your lifestyle choices, 
                and environmental factors, collectively contribute to the pace at which you age. This complex interaction also influences 
                your susceptibility to various age-related health conditions and consequently how long you live.      
            </p>
            <p>
                Here at QuantumLife Inc, our expertise lies in conducting comprehensive Genetic Risk Carriers Screening and Analysis. 
                Our principal objective is to deliver personalized genomic data that can illuminate your genetic predisposition towards 
                hereditary health conditions and diseases and provide insights into your potential physical fitness. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In our pursuit of this mission, we employ Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)â€”a state-of-the-art technology that deciphers an 
                individual's DNA sequence, comprising approximately three billion base pairs. WGS grants us a panoramic view of the entire 
                genome, enabling the detection of genetic variants that could potentially influence your health and disease susceptibility. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Armed with this knowledge, you gain the power to make well-informed decisions concerning your health, lifestyle, 
                and preventive care. Our services aim to demystify the intricate realm of genomics, forging a clear path from raw genetic 
                information to actionable health insights. At QuantumLife Inc, we are your trusted partner in navigating the complex life 
                journey from genetic understanding to your life goal Healthy Aging and Longevity.

        <p>
            This section includes variants that, when found by themselves, are associated with high and moderate genetic risk
            of developing a disease. Depending on a variant zygosity and disease inheritance, the disease can affect you or
            represent a risk for the next generation (carrier variants).

            The c.1564_1565delGA frameshift variant is predicted to truncate the ATM protein, resulting in a loss or
            deficient function. The variant has been identified in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state in
            individuals affected with ataxia-telangiectasia (PMID 9463314, PMID 10817650, PMID 9000145, PMID
            12497634, PMID 21965147), as well as in an individual diagnosed with breast cancer (PMID 27083775).
            The ATM gene codes for an enzyme called serine-protein kinase. This enzyme plays a key role in DNA damage
            response by transducing checkpoint signaling, cell cycle regulation, and tumor suppression. Pathogenic ATM
            variants result in impaired response to DNA damage, cell death, and formation of cancerous tumors and are
            associated with autosomal dominant susceptibility to breast cancer (MIM 114480) and autosomal recessive
            ataxia-telangiectasia (AT, MIM 208900). Women with a pathogenic ATM variant have a 5-to 9-fold increased
            risk of breast cancer (PMID 1961222, PMID 15928302). There is also some evidence supporting an association
            with autosomal dominant pancreatic, colorectal, prostate, and possibly other cancers (PMID 26483394, PMID
            15928302, PMID 26662178). Ataxia-telangiectasia a childhood-onset disease characterized by progressive
            cerebellar ataxia, neurologic degeneration, conjunctival telangiectasias, immunodeficiency and increased risk of
            leukemia and lymphoma as well as other cancers (PMID 20301790). The worldwide prevalence of ataxiatelangiectasia 
            is unknown, however, the estimated prevalence in the US ranges from 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 100,000
            live births (PMID 20301790).
